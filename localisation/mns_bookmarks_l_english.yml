 SHATTERED_ENGLAND:0 "A Hundred More"
 SHATTERED_ENGLAND_DESC:0 "The Hundred Years War is over, but not with a vitory for either party. A century of war caused decay within the Kingdoms of England and France, and when Henry VI of England finally left this world, his kingdom descended into civil war. Hoping to take advantage of this internal weakness, Charles VII of France launched a final offensive against the English footholds in Normandy and Gascony. Unbeknownst to Charles, factions within the French kingdom had been waiting for the royal levy to leave Paris unoccupied so they could launch a revolt of their own. Initially over tax obligations, the once-centralized revolt quickly fell apart, leaving every duke and count out for himself. The end of the Hundred Years War may set the stage for a hundred more..."
 SHATTERED_MUSLIM:0 "Enrique's Legacy"
 SHATTERED_MUSLIM_DESC:0 "The weak and ineffectual rule of Enrique IV of Castile had dire consequences for the Kingdom. In a last-ditch attmept to save Castile, a group of loyal noblemen tried to dispose Enrique in favor of his distant cousin, but their plan went awry and during the panic Enrique was killed. Leaving no male heir, a succession crisis emerged between his three daughters: Joanna, Queen of Portugal; Isabella, Queen of Aragon; and Blanche, supported by Navarre and the remaining Castilian loyalists. During the conflict, Granada, supported by Morocco and the Ottomans, joined the fray, seeking to regain parts of once-Muslim Iberia. Granada was successful in instigating Muslim rebellions, though at price to herself. The war in Iberia ended in stalemate after the nobility on all sides seized the moment and declared their own petty Kingdoms. Young Blanche sits on the once-mighty throne of Castile, with ideas of another reconquista being whispered into her ear..."
 SHATTERED_EMPIRE:0 "Nor an Empire"
 SHATTERED_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "While Italy remains nominally pary of the Empire, the triumph of the Guelfs has taken its toll. The defeated Italian Ghibellines in Savoy, Florence, and Milan were forced to loosen their grip on the victorious Guelf cities they once lorded over, though the more diplomatically-capable Ghibelline holdouts like Verona were spared this treatment. Verona and other formery-Venetian territories used the solidarity of the Guelf revolt to declare their own independence, leaving Trevixo as the last pale of Venetian rule. During the Italian revolt, many nobles within the Empire declared their own revolts, primarily against the Emperor in Austria. His direct vassals successfully instated more autonomous rule to the point of independence. In Bohemia, many vassals have denounced the King in Prague for his Hussite-leaning views, with some cities like Budweiß promising fealty to neighbouring duchies for religious protection."
