 mns_info.1.exit: "Nevermind"
 mns_info.2.t: "Formable Nations"
 mns_info.2.d: "There are a large number of formable nations added, too many to list. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\nAll formation decisions you see at the start of the game are EXCLUSIVE, so you can only form one of the nations listed.\nAfter forming a nation, you may unlock larger and more challenging nations to form later on.\nIdeas of formable nations are typically powerful, so you should almost always switch to a new idea set if offered."
 mns_info.100.t: "Ideas"
 mns_info.100.d: "This mod uses a version of idea variation, designed with fun and balance in mind. The ideas tab should be self explanatory in how some groups require others to unlock and are exclusive with each other."
 mns_info.200.t: "New Goods"
 mns_info.200.d: "There are seven new trade goods, one unlocked every 50 years. In addition to good trading-in bonuses, they also have powerful local bonuses. The new goods are:\nLeather (1430), Guns (1480 and so on...), Paper*, Steel, Rum, Optics, Uniforms, and Coal.\n*Vanilla paper has been replaced with beer by Typus."
 mns_info.300.t: "New Religions"
 mns_info.300.d: "There are a good number of new religions, however they do not use the old system of Pagan Sentiment. This caused lots of hardware strain and was rather unintuitive. In its place, religions can now be enabled and converted to via decision.\n For most new Catholic religions, 50 Reformation Desire is required to start openly adopting heresy."
 mns_info.400.t: "Aggressive Expansion Changes"
 mns_info.400.d: "There are some experimental changes to aggressive expansion added to try to make early-game HRE expansion more fun. And fast. These numbers will likely change, so enjoy them while you can!"
