 VRA_ideas: "Scaligeri Ideas"
 VRA_ideas_start: "Scaligeri Traditions"
 VRA_ideas_bonus: "Scaligeri Ambition"
 VRA_idea_1: "The Pen"
 VRA_idea_1_desc: "The Scaligeri rulers of old were able to extend their influence far across Italy via purchasing the lordship of towns. Through diplomacy, we can extend our power without disrupting the gentle balance of Italy."
 VRA_idea_2: "The Sword"
 VRA_idea_2_desc: "The pen does not always bear fruit. When stubborn lords refuse to submit, we have no choice but to force their hand. Physically."
 VRA_idea_3: "Beautification of Verona"
 VRA_idea_3_desc: "Cansignorio, while often remembered for his kinslaying practises, was also foremost in improving the lands of Veròna, building many great palaces and aqueducts. We must continue his legacy of development."
 VRA_idea_4: "Captiani di Ventura"
 VRA_idea_4_desc: "A reliance on mercenaries, an affliction present all across Italy, has its benefits and its downsides. While our hired troops often come home with victories, one wonders if our captain simply bribed the enemy..."
 VRA_idea_5: "Relics of Cangrande II"
 VRA_idea_5_desc: "Cangrande II was famously paranoid, and trusted nobody except for his mercenaries. The secret passages and diplomatic corps he assembled are still in place, granting the current lords of Veròna more safety."
 VRA_idea_6: "Legacy of Mastino II"
 VRA_idea_6_desc: "Mastino II foolhardily abandoned the cautious policy that had dictated both his ancestors and the rest of Italy. In siezing Brescia, Parma, and Lucca, he forced the creation of a defensive league that brought Veròna to heel. His attempts at the recovery of his lost lands was fueled by mercenaries, and was almost successful. If we seek to break the balance of power in Italy, we will need a lot of hired guns."
 VRA_idea_7: "Support of the People"
 VRA_idea_7_desc: "Whenever they have been subject to foreign occupation, the people of Veròna have always fiercly resisted the demands of their captors. They know that our rule is just, and they will fight to preserve it."

 NEV_idea_6: "Forge Forgery"
 NEV_idea_6_desc: "Many other cities across Europe believe they are in competition with us for producing the finest steel. Despite their fantastical dreams of ever reaching our level of metal quality their competition is still harmful to our industrial output. As such we should take steps to prevent their inferior steel from entering our lands."
 NEV_idea_7: "Invest in the Countryside"
 NEV_idea_7_desc: "The lands surrounding Nevers have been neglected by our administration, due to our incessant focus on our steel production. To rectify this, we have supplied all of the farmers in our kingdom with steel plows to help increase their production. We are sure this gift will be well received."

 SWB_idea_5_desc: "The lords and counts of Swabia were formerly united by the Swabian Circle, a loose organization for administration and mutual defense. With Swabia now being united under a single realm, there is an even greater connection between the various cities and castles of the land."

 ANV_idea_1: "A Feudal Legacy"
 ANV_idea_1_desc: "Castles and Châteaus dominate the fertile plains of the Loire and Garonne, and our policy of decentralized feudal administration brings the local lords of these manors great wealth."
 ANV_idea_2: "On the Backs of Others"
 ANV_idea_2_desc: "While some of our vassals may hold significant power simply due to the natural resources afforded to them, our house's strength lies not in riches from the fields or beneath the Earth - we shall instead make our fortune from the vast realm we are in command of, regardless of any dreams of autonomy our vassals petition for."
 ANV_idea_3: "Last Archery Tournament"
 ANV_idea_3_desc: "The age of the longbow is over - no longer can we rely on the strength of our archers to secure victory. A grand military reform is in order if we wish to return to our position of supremacy, but this time we must ensure all soldiers are loyal only to the Crown."
 ANV_idea_4: "Abolition of Venal Offices"
 ANV_idea_4_desc: "As asimilar as they might appear, the lords of Northumbria and Aquitaine have one thing in common: their distance from Anjou. In the past, our control over their affairs has slipped in no small part due to the sale of administrative offices. By refusing to simply give state positions to the highest bidder, we can instead appoint capable and loyal candidates who can far better enforce our rule."
 ANV_idea_5: "Our Sea"
 ANV_idea_5_desc: "With control of both shores of the Channel, we find ourselves in an incredibly fortunate position following the discovery of new trade routes in the Indies. No matter where trade may flow, as long as it passes through the channel we profit."
 ANV_idea_6: "A Reformed Dual Monarchy"
 ANV_idea_6_desc: "A unification of two crowns can often lead to instability and feelings of resentment in the lesser realm. This is not the case in our Empire, however, as we have succeeded in combining the national identities of England and France into one shared history."
 ANV_idea_7: "The Harmonious Union"
 ANV_idea_7_desc: "The lands of France and England are of a natural complement: Raw goods from France flow into England, where manufactured products are then exported across the channel. In later years we may find ourselves at the precipice of revolution - an industrial revolution!"
